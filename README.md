## About Me
Maryam Torkashvand

I am a Ph.D. student in GIS science and Cartography at the University of Iowa, with a passion for geographic information science, geospatial data analysis, and human geography. My current research focuses on analyzing kinship networks and migration regions in the US, using family tree datasets and historical census data to understand better migration patterns over the settlement period and how they affect kinship networks. In addition to my work on migration, I have published research papers in other areas, including groundwater vulnerability and risk assessment. I have presented my research at various conferences and am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others in the field.
